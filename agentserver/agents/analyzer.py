    ASSESSMENT REQUIREMENTS:
    Provide a comprehensive autism spectrum disorder assessment based on DSM-5 criteria, including:
    
    1. SOCIAL COMMUNICATION ANALYSIS:
       - Turn-taking patterns and conversational flow
       - Eye contact indicators from facial data  
       - Pragmatic language use and contextual appropriateness
       - Social reciprocity markers
    
    2. BEHAVIORAL PATTERN ASSESSMENT:
       - Repetitive behaviors from video analysis
       - Sensory processing indicators from emotional responses
       - Attention patterns and regulation markers
       - Self-regulation behaviors
    
    3. SPEECH & LANGUAGE EVALUATION:
       - Prosodic patterns from speech analysis
       - Vocal characteristics and modulation
       - Language patterns and pragmatic usage
    
    4. CONFIDENCE & UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS:
       - Overall assessment confidence based on data quality
       - Areas of uncertainty or conflicting indicators
       - Data sufficiency for reliable assessment
    
    5. PROFESSIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS:
       - Evaluation priority level (low/moderate/high/urgent)
       - Suggested next steps for comprehensive assessment
       - Monitoring recommendations
    
    CRITICAL SCORING REQUIREMENTS: 
    - Base your assessment solely on the provided data. Do not infer or assume information not present in the conversation and behavioral data.
    - ALL NUMERIC SCORES MUST BE DECIMAL VALUES BETWEEN 0.0 AND 1.0 (inclusive):
      * 0.0 = no evidence/absence/lowest possible score
      * 0.1-0.3 = minimal/low evidence or presence
      * 0.4-0.6 = moderate/average evidence or presence  
      * 0.7-0.9 = strong/high evidence or presence
      * 1.0 = definitive/maximum evidence/highest possible score
    - Confidence scores: 0.0 = completely uncertain, 1.0 = completely certain
    - Likelihood scores: 0.0 = definitely not present, 1.0 = definitely present
    - Use decimal precision (e.g., 0.67, 0.23, 0.91) for nuanced scoring
    - Every numeric field in the response must be a decimal between 0.0 and 1.0
